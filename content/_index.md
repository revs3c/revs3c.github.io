👋 Hey there! I'm **[Revs3c]** — passionate about all things **cybersecurity** and digital defense.  
I've proudly earned my **CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker)** certification 🛡️, and I've been diving deep into tools like **Nmap**, **Burp Suite**, **Wireshark**, and more.

🔍 I love exploring CTFs, solving real-world hacking challenges, and constantly pushing my boundaries.  
This site is my **knowledge hub** — packed with writeups, notes, and everything I'm learning along the way.
